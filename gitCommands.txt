git checkout -f develop
git status
git branch --list
git branch
git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
git push origin FB-Name
git --exec-path
git --version
to remove a particular file do - git rm Helloworld.txt(just give the file name)
to rename a existing branch(i.e working copy) do - git branch -m <desiredbranchName>    
for suppose we have a working copy name as "files" and you want to rename it as CQ5File then follow the below example 
eg: git branch -m CQ5File
                         or 
to rename a exisiting branch working copy do - git branch -m <existing branchName> <desiredbranchName>
for suppose we have a working copy name as "files" and you want to rename it as "CQ5File" then follow the below example 
eg: git branch -m files CQ5File

I mistakenly added files using the command
git add file
I have not yet run git commit. Is there a way to undo this or remove these files from the commit?

eg: You have added a single file using ---   git add <filename>  

and now you want to undo this single file from the commit.In this case just do ---  git reset <filename>

you have added a multiple files using command ---    git add .
and now you want undo these files from the commit --- git reset
